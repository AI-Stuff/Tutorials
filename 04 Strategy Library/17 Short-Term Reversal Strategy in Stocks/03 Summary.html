  In the paper, the look-back period is from 1990 to 2009. However, we want to test whether the strategy is still profitable in the new time period. Hence we use different look-back periods instead.
  If we begin from 2005 and end in 2017, there will be a total return of 131.50%. Although to some extent the performance of this strategy is dependent on different market situations,?nevertheless, in either situation mentioned above, this strategy could significantly beat the S&amp;P 500 benchmark.
  Further research and backtesting could be done on different look-back periods, rebalancing frequencies, investment universes, numbers of traded stocks, etc.
